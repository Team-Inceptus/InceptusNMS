The goal of this project is to attempt to emulate a JDK 17 JavaDocs-style Browser for the Mojang-Mapped NMS Mappings and CraftBukkit Server, in order to make NMS and CraftBukkit Development easier and more accessible.

### ❓How Does it Work?

We use a custom parser to parse JSON files stored in our `docs` folder to emulate a JavaDocs browser. Developed in Kotlin and Java, the parser is able to parse the JSON files and generate a JavaDocs-style browser for the NMS and CraftBukkit Server.
